# BeatMapper

A novel 2D rhythm game editor concept produced over one semester written in C# using the Unity3D game engine. Beatmapper is a simple vertical scrolling rhythm game (VSRG) with a built-in editor that attempts to introduce an intuitive way to compose beatmaps. Contrary to other complicated tools with high barriers to entry, Beatmapper allows the users to simply record beatmaps as though they were playing the game. Users can import external audio files to create beatmaps of their favourite songs, or even import existing beatmaps from other existing rhythm games, such as osu!, to add their own twist.

The player may play the maps created or imported by using four keys on their keyboard and hitting the oncoming notes to the beat of the song. Hitting the notes closer to the beat of the song would reward the player with a greater number of points earned. At the end of the song, the player would be graded based on their gameplay performance.
